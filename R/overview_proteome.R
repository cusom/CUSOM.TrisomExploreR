                  In biology, proteins are the functional molecules that result when a gene is expressed and that perform most of the biological processes needed for life. 
                  Many factors can affect the expression and function of proteins, and abnormal protein expression or function can play a role in health and disease. 
                  Therefore, by measuring the levels of many different proteins (i.e. the &ldquo;proteome&rdquo;), 
                  we can understand differences in protein levels and explore how those differences may affect health conditions.
